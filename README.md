# Mini Greenmonster

This is a python script to turn your raspberry pi into a small version of the Fenway Park Green Monster scoreboard.

The script uses the MLB api to update the scoreboard in real time.

The script right now updates the balls, strikes and outs in real time.

To do :

Add two digit seven segment display for at bat

Add 2 two digit seven segment display for score

Add 1 digit seven segment display for inning

Add 2 leds for top and bottom of innings

Make a nice container for the board.
